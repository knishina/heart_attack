# heart_attack

### Summary.
This project takes data consisting of attributes that are hypothesized to contribute to heart disease.  The purpose of this project is to take the data and generate a predictive model for heart disease.  The data was obtained through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

The data have fourteen attributes.  They include:
 - `age` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in years
 - `sex` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1 = male; 0 = female)
 - `cp` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; chest pain type
 - `trestbps` resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
 - `chol` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;serum cholestoral in mg/dl
 - `fbs` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
 - `restecg` &nbsp; resting electrocardiographic results
 - `thalach` &nbsp; maximum heart rate achieved
 - `exang` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
 - `oldpeak` &nbsp; ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
 - `slope` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
 - `ca` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
 - `thal` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
 - `target` &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 or 0 (I think this means 1= heart attack; 0=no heart attack)
